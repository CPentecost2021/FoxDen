	<h2>The Gym</h2>
	<p>Words that can be as scary as "Hey you wanna go stay in the haunted house for a week?" It is not as easy as most people think.  As a person who has struggled with his weight for most of my life I have learned that alot of the issues are deeply ingrained in how I feel and what makes me happy.  I had never worked out before except for riding my bike outside and goign for the odd walk in nature.  The Machines were all strange to me.  As someone who (again aging myself) remembers Dennis Leary's comic bit about exercise and the stairmaster...I really wondered why I was there.  Oh yeah I worked for the Gym.  It jump started my fitness journey.  Now 18 years on and I now have a trainer Lisle, the Evil Coach. As well as a new drive to be as healthy as I can be.  With 2 children at home and a pandemic raging has renewed a fire to get myself in a better place.  I look forward to embracing in sharing my successes and failures. Join me going forward on this journey to find a balance of health.</p>

		<h2>Food</h2>
		<p>For my first food post i wanted to introduce you to a delicious and easy recipe for a Pancetta Cream Sauce.  As I am continuing to learn how to utilize new technology (at least to me), Here is my first take at Vlogging me cooking.  I hope to learn more about Adobe's Premire Pro to get a smoother transitioned video.</p>

		  <h2>Personal Development</h2>
			<p>The journey starts with the first step. Like Bill Murray in What About Bob? baby steps are a great way to start.  I got to a point in my career where I relyed too much on the software developers to explain how things worked. Which always led me to ask more questions. I felt like the tortise in the race to get things out the door. So I looked for ways to learn.  Ways to expand on what I was being taught aon the job.  I am used to doing things backwards, so when I finally signed up for my first web development course I was nervous.  I have never taken an online course, never had to be as self driven with reading and understanding new concepts without being able to face to face ask questions.  It was frusterating at first but it soon became easier.  A lot of the concepts that should have been new to me were vaguely familiar and soon the pieces started to fit like a a pro tetris game.</p>

			<p>I will admit there are still things about development that I still do not understand.  But there are things I can now look at and not see Neo's first look at the Matrix.  The code is bringing into focus the world behind the screen.  I look forward to continuing these posts.  The first like Baby Steps are small, but I hope to delve deeper into my journey through Web Developement to UI/UX Design. </p>
